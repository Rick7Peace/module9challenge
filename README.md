# module9challenge# 09 Servers and APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Development

  I Created a API key from https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}] inorder to use a External API that allows developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

## TA Omar Daghestani helped with codes.

## Functionality
You can see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO anyone can plan a trip accordingly
